/**
 * Property lookup uses ChainPropProviders containing LeafPropProviders.
 *
 * Each ChainPropProvider is at its core a Seq[LeafPropProvider] created
 * by following the dfdl:ref attribute 'chain' of a DFDLFormatAnnotation from
 * one format annotation to another by way of a named define format.
 *
 * A LeafPropProvider corresponds directly to a DFDLFormatAnnotation. It
 * can supply properties from the short, long, and element form property bindings
 * found on that object alone. It insures they are non-overlapping.
 *
 * Ultimately, a schema component will have two sequences of ChainPropProviders.
 * One for non-default properties (these must be tested to be sure they are
 * non-overlapping), and one for default properties. Those are assembed by
 * each schema component in a component-specific manner.
